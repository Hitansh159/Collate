## Motivation
- As a developer, programmer, student , we do a lot of searching and perusing through documentation, articles, links, research paper,etc.  
- So often , we find ourselves not able to find that article that we read, that amazing tutorial link, that github repo which has solution for our assignment , research paper, the list is endless.   
- Obviously , you can store web pages in bookmarks or google docs or even notepad. But we can all agree that is not ideal.  
- This was the motivation behind **Collate** , to help us/you organize and collect information at a single place.
